This app fascilitates the management of coding events with functionality to create, delete, modify, and store various coding events in a MySQL database using Hibernate. 

The app currently has all the above functioanlity but there are plans in the future to allow users to create accounts to better manage events of individual users.
This will be possible through the use of a Person Entity class and a PersonRepository interface to which various events will be tied to when the user signs up for them.
